# Concert Travel App - Development Roadmap

## Strategic Vision & Requirements

### Backend Foundation & Scalability
- **Scale Target**: 10s of thousands of users, hundreds to thousands of concurrent users
- **Architecture**: Stateless, horizontally scalable, production-ready
- **Travel Integration**: Direct integration with travel and event ticketing APIs
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with fee collection logic
- **Event Types**: Music, comedy, sports, theater, Las Vegas Sphere events
- **Future Features**: Group trips, social media integration, tour following (multi-show trips)

### Frontend Redesign Focus
- **Primary Focus**: User interests and suggested trips (not event discovery)
- **Onboarding**: Interview flow for preferences, Spotify integration, destination preferences
- **Interest Prioritization**: Drag-and-drop ranking of artists/genres
- **Mandatory Address**: For proximity-based event prioritization
- **Natural Language UI**: Chat-style interface for trip planning
- **Travel Integration**: "Find me a trip between dates" and "I'm traveling to X, what events are happening?"

### Mobile Strategy
- **Platform**: React Native for iOS and Android
- **API Design**: RESTful/GraphQL, stateless for easy mobile integration
- **Features**: Push notifications, deep linking, OAuth flows

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation for Scale & Extensibility

#### Backend
- [x] Refactor for statelessness, add rate limiting, prepare for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Abstract event/travel providers for extensibility
- [ ] Add support for multiple event types (music, sports, comedy, theater, etc.)
- [ ] Prepare database for group trips, multi-event trips, and social features

#### Frontend
- [x] Redesign dashboard to focus on suggested trips and user interests
- [ ] Implement onboarding interview and interest prioritization
- [ ] Make user address mandatory in profile
- [x] Move event/travel discovery to secondary tabs

#### Mobile
- [ ] Set up shared API layer, basic navigation, and authentication

### Phase 2: Core Booking & Payment Flow
- [ ] Integrate travel and ticketing APIs
- [ ] Implement trip customization and bundling logic
- [ ] Integrate Stripe for payments, including fee logic
- [ ] Build booking management and confirmation flows

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add group trip and social features
- [ ] Enhance trip suggestion engine for tours/multi-event trips
- [ ] Add natural language UI (chatbot interface)
- [ ] Expand event types and provider integrations

### Phase 4: Mobile App Expansion
- [ ] Build out full mobile app features
- [ ] Add push notifications and deep linking

## Critical Best Practices (Ongoing)

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Structured logging (Winston, Pino)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- User analytics
- Health checks (/health endpoint)

### Privacy & Compliance
- GDPR compliance
- Data privacy laws
- Secure data handling

### Testing
- Automated backend tests
- Frontend component tests
- Integration tests
- User flow testing

### Documentation
- Architecture documentation
- API documentation
- Code documentation
- User guides

### DevOps
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated deployments
- Infrastructure as code
- Docker containerization

## Trip Purchase Architecture

### Flow
1. User clicks suggested trip
2. Backend generates customizable options for each component:
   - Event tickets
   - Flights
   - Accommodations
   - Transportation
3. User customizes and selects options (bundles or a la carte)
4. Pricing and "best match" logic handled server-side
5. User proceeds to payment
6. Bookings made via provider APIs
7. Confirmation and itinerary generated

### Bundling Options
- **Best Match**: Matches user preferences best
- **Budget Friendly**: Cost-optimized options
- **First Class**: Premium options
- **A La Carte**: Individual component selection

### Payment Integration
- **Primary**: Stripe (supports Apple Pay, Google Pay, cards)
- **Fee Logic**: Percentage of total booked price
- **Booking Management**: Store references, allow cancellations/changes
- **Notifications**: Email/SMS confirmations, reminders

## Provider Abstraction Strategy

### Event Providers
- Ticketmaster
- Eventbrite
- AXS
- Venue-specific APIs

### Travel Providers
- **Flights**: Amadeus, Skyscanner, Sabre
- **Hotels**: Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com
- **Transportation**: Uber, Lyft, local transit APIs

### Architecture Pattern
- Provider interface/abstraction layer
- Easy to swap or add new integrations
- Consistent API responses
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Current Status

### Completed
- âœ… Basic backend structure (Node.js/Express)
- âœ… Database migrations and seed scripts
- âœ… User authentication system
- âœ… Spotify integration (with fixes for re-auth and cross-user data issues)
- âœ… Amadeus API integration for flights
- âœ… Event management system
- âœ… Trip planning services foundation

### In Progress
- âœ… Backend scalability refactor (Phase 1) - COMPLETED
- ðŸ”„ Frontend UI redesign (Phase 1)

### Next Priority
- Backend refactor for statelessness and horizontal scaling
- Rate limiting and security hardening
- Provider abstraction layer
- Frontend dashboard redesign focusing on suggested trips

## Notes
- This roadmap should be referenced for all development decisions
- All work should incorporate monitoring, analytics, privacy, testing, documentation, and DevOps best practices
- Focus on scalability and extensibility from the beginning
- User experience should prioritize suggested trips over manual discovery
- Natural language interface is a key differentiator for future phases
